# scala-reactive-coursera

Solutions and some study code for Principles of Reactive Programming course (spring 2015).

Solutions have not been submitted, so they may not be 100% correct.

Some solutions are partly or fully copied from another github repos because of more elegant implementations than mine. C est la vie =)
